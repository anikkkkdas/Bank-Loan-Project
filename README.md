# Loan Portfolio Dashboard

## Overview
This project aims to design and develop a **Loan Portfolio Dashboard** that provides a clear summary of key performance indicators (KPIs) for monitoring loan applications, funded amounts, repayments, and borrower health. The dashboard will help stakeholders evaluate the performance of loans, track trends over time, and make data-driven decisions.
